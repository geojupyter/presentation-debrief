Every domain needs geospatial data, especially organizations fighting for our
environment.
These domains face shared challenges around working with geospatial data.

:stop_sign: Once you're in a proprietary system, the owners' interest is inherently in
keeping you there.

:lock: Proprietary systems are often _not_ interoperable, by design.
You cannot move freely between them.

:bug: Proprietary systems are often [as buggy or
buggier](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcGIS/comments/1dp7308/i_feel_like_esri_releases_buggy_af_updates/) than open source alternatives.

:::notes
Often cloud users are enticed with initial ease of use and low costs.

As cloud users continue building in a non-interoperable system, they accumulate inertia,
making it harder to leave.
Additionally, they often discover that they require more services than they initially
assessed, and their costs increase unpredictably over time as it's easier to buy one
more service than it is to migrate.
