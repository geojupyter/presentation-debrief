Every domain needs geospatial data, especially organizations fighting for our
environment.
These domains face shared challenges around working with geospatial data.

:stop_sign: Once you're in a proprietary system, the owners' interest is inherently in
keeping you there.

:lock: Proprietary systems are often _not_ interoperable, by design.
You cannot move freely between them.

:bug: Proprietary systems are often
[as buggy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcGIS/comments/1dp7308/i_feel_like_esri_releases_buggy_af_updates/)
or
[buggier](https://www.google.com/search?q=esri+error+999999)

:::notes
Often cloud users are enticed with initial ease of use and low costs.

As cloud users continue building in a non-interoperable system, they accumulate inertia,
making it harder to leave.
Additionally, they often discover that they require more services than they initially
assessed, and their costs increase unpredictably over time as it's easier to buy one
more service than it is to migrate.

Proprietary systems are often as buggy or buggier than open source alternatives, but
human biases like "sunk cost" cause us to be more forgiving towards software we've paid
for.
Perhaps because of this reduced accountability to their users, proprietary tools also
often offer less respectful error messages than those found in community-owned software.

## A sustainable community

:::{style="font-size: 1.5rem"}
GeoJupyter's answer to the status quo is a **sustainable** and **self-directing** community.

<br/>

Our community aims to combine the **approachability** and **playfulness** of desktop GIS tools, the
**flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding-driven GIS methods, and the
**collaborative** and **storytelling** power of Jupyter.
:::

<br/>

Together, we can
[**reimagine geospatial interactive computing**]{style="color: #f37626"}
to enable more researchers, educators, and learners to **confidently engage with
geospatial data**.


## GeoJupyter is... {.smaller}

* 100% open source, modular and interoperable.
* Cloud-native, can run anywhere (laptop, supercomputers, ‚Ä¶)
* Capable of:
    * Traditional GIS workloads.
    * Complex, code-driven workflows with earth/planetary data.
    * Leveraging the entire Scientific Python ecosystem.
* AI-ready
* Locally controlled, private, secure
* Vendor agnostic (including commercial AI)
* Led at Berkeley, with US and international partners who are eager

## Closing

:::notes
I've spoken about how this project stands to benefit the world, and I'd like to close by sharing how this work has affected me personally.
Some mornings, I have to remind myself that this project is real and that I'm being supported to work on it.
This mission is important, and I feel privileged to be taking part in it, and to be working with the talented and brilliant folks I am.
Thank you for this wonderful opportunity to grow personally and professionally!
